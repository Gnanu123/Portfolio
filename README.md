Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Smart home system

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.

### Sales analysis
This project involves the analysis and visualization of sales data for a Organisation using Power BI. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the year-to-date (YTD) sales performance, compare it against the previous year's data (PYTD), and identify key metrics that impact profitability and sales growth. The insights provided help in making data-driven decisions for better sales and profitability management.

### Flight reviews analysis
This project involves the analysis and visualization of customer reviews for Airways using Tableau. The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of customer feedback across various metrics, including service quality, entertainment, seat comfort, and value for money. The insights derived from this analysis can help identify key areas of improvement and enhance the overall customer experience.
